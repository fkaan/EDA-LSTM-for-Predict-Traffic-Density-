Predict urban traffic density using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, combined with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in time-series traffic data.

## üìå Project Overview

**Objective**: Forecast traffic density (vehicles/hour) at key urban intersections using historical sensor data.  
**Key Workflow**:
1. Exploratory analysis of traffic patterns
2. Time-series feature engineering
3. LSTM-based density prediction
4. Model interpretation and deployment recommendations

**Key Questions**:
- How do traffic patterns vary by time of day/day of week?
- What external factors (weather, events) correlate with traffic spikes?
- How far into the future can we reliably predict congestion?

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
